# UI Context

## Theme

Dark only. No light mode. The visual language is a dark technical workspace — near-black backgrounds, layered surfaces, and vivid accent colors for interactive elements.

All colors are defined as CSS custom properties in `globals.css` and mapped to Tailwind tokens via `@theme inline`. Components must use these tokens — no hardcoded hex values or raw Tailwind color classes like `zinc-*`.

| Role             | CSS Variable           | Hex / Value               |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Page background  | `--bg-base`            | `#080809`                 |
| Surface          | `--bg-surface`         | `#111114`                 |
| Elevated surface | `--bg-elevated`        | `#18181c`                 |
| Subtle surface   | `--bg-subtle`          | `#1e1e23`                 |
| Default border   | `--border-default`     | `#2a2a30`                 |
| Subtle border    | `--border-subtle`      | `#3a3a42`                 |
| Primary text     | `--text-primary`       | `#f0f0f4`                 |
| Secondary text   | `--text-secondary`     | `#c0c0cc`                 |
| Muted text       | `--text-muted`         | `#808090`                 |
| Faint text       | `--text-faint`         | `#505060`                 |
| Brand accent     | `--accent-primary`     | `#00c8d4` (cyan)          |
| Brand dim        | `--accent-primary-dim` | `rgba(0, 200, 212, 0.12)` |
| AI accent        | `--accent-ai`          | `#6457f9` (indigo-purple) |
| AI text          | `--accent-ai-text`     | `#8b82ff`                 |
| Error            | `--state-error`        | `#ff4d4f`                 |
| Success          | `--state-success`      | `#34d399`                 |
| Warning          | `--state-warning`      | `#fbbf24`                 |

Tailwind utility names map to these variables. Use `bg-base`, `bg-surface`, `text-copy-primary`, `text-copy-muted`, `border-surface-border`, `text-brand`, `bg-accent-dim`, etc.

## Typography

| Role      | Font       | CSS Variable        |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------------- |
| UI text   | Geist Sans | `--font-geist-sans` |
| Code/mono | Geist Mono | `--font-geist-mono` |

Both fonts are loaded via `next/font/google` and applied as CSS variables on the `<html>` element. The base `body` uses Geist Sans with `antialiased`.

## Border Radius

Radius increases with surface depth — smaller for inner elements, larger for outer containers.

| Context           | Class         |
| ----------------- | ------------- |
| Inline / small UI | `rounded-xl`  |
| Cards / panels    | `rounded-2xl` |
| Modal / overlay   | `rounded-3xl` |

## Canvas

### Node Color Palette

8 defined color pairs. Each pair specifies a dark node fill and a vivid contrasting text color tuned for readability on the dark canvas. Defined in `types/canvas.ts` as `NODE_COLORS`.

| Node fill | Text color | Character              |
| --------- | ---------- | ---------------------- |
| `#1F1F1F` | `#EDEDED`  | Neutral dark (default) |
| `#10233D` | `#52A8FF`  | Blue                   |
| `#2E1938` | `#BF7AF0`  | Purple                 |
| `#331B00` | `#FF990A`  | Orange                 |
| `#3C1618` | `#FF6166`  | Red                    |
| `#3A1726` | `#F75F8F`  | Pink                   |
| `#0F2E18` | `#62C073`  | Green                  |
| `#062822` | `#0AC7B4`  | Teal                   |

Default node color: `#1F1F1F` with `#EDEDED` text.

### Edge Style

Smooth-step path with an arrow marker. Default edge color: `#f8fafc`. Stroke width is thin — edges are visually secondary to nodes.

### Node Shapes

6 supported shapes, defined in `types/canvas.ts` as `NODE_SHAPES`. Complex shapes (diamond, hexagon, cylinder) are rendered as inline SVGs rather than CSS borders.

- `rectangle` — default general-purpose node
- `diamond` — decision / gateway
- `circle` — event / endpoint
- `pill` — service / process
- `cylinder` — database / storage
- `hexagon` — external system / boundary

### Connection Handles

Small white circular handles, hidden by default, revealed on node hover. Appear at all four sides of a node.

### Canvas Background

React Flow `<Background>` component. Canvas sits on the base background color.

### Canvas Interaction Model

- Dragging empty canvas selects multiple nodes with a visible selection rectangle.
- Middle or right-dragging empty canvas pans the viewport; mouse wheel zooms.
- Node and edge selection is local UI state only and must not be persisted or broadcast.
- Selected nodes can move as a group, and Delete/Backspace removes selected nodes and edges.
- Node labels must be editable through an explicit Add/Edit label control as well as double-click.
- Edge labels must expose a persistent `+` bubble on the edge, support multiple label bubbles, and keep `data.label` mirrored to the first label for compatibility.
- Existing edges can be reconnected by dragging an endpoint to another compatible node handle.
- Canvas controls include a compact help popover that explains selection, panning, labels, reconnecting, and saving.
- Semantic templates appear alongside shape templates for service, database, worker, and auth-module nodes.
- Nodes show a compact semantic type badge; unclassified nodes use warning styling.
- Selected nodes and edges expose a local property inspector for semantic type, common metadata, and S1 type-specific fields.
- Edge semantic type is edited from the inspector and may show a compact badge only during active edge interaction.
- Semantic warnings are advisory and do not block saving.
- Service nodes can create and open a service-internal drill-down canvas through `subcanvasRef`; the editor URL carries the active `graphId`, the breadcrumb returns to the system root, and empty service graphs show a compact internal-design guide. Other subcanvas-capable semantic node types keep placeholder readiness affordances until their drill-down scopes are implemented.
- Service-internal canvases expose compact semantic templates for endpoints, entities, workers, event contracts, business rules, validation rules, and policies while preserving the same React Flow interaction model.

## Component Library

shadcn/ui on top of Tailwind. No custom design system. Components live in `components/ui/`. Use the `shadcn` CLI to add new components rather than writing them from scratch.

## Layout Patterns

- Editor workspace: full-viewport layout with a responsive cockpit shell. On large viewports, open left and right sidebars reserve canvas gutters so canvas tools and semantic inspectors do not sit underneath them.
- Sidebars: floating glass panels with dark semi-transparent background and subtle border. On smaller viewports, the project sidebar behaves like a modal navigation deck with a strong backdrop instead of competing with canvas inspectors.
- Canvas graph breadcrumb: a small glass overlay sits below the navbar; it identifies the current graph and lets users jump from a service drill-down back to the system root without overlapping the sidebars or inspector.
- Workspace navbar actions compress to icon-only controls on small viewports, while desktop keeps text labels for faster scanning.
- Compact account menu: on small workspaces, the avatar remains the only navbar account trigger and opens a compact cockpit-style popover with Account and Sign out actions layered above the mobile project deck.
- Design IR preview/export: the workspace navbar exposes a compact `FileJson` action that opens a bounded cockpit-style modal with status, compiled graph IDs, validation counts, JSON preview, Copy JSON, and Download JSON. Design IR is machine-readable architecture. Prompt Pack generation is not active yet.
- Modals and dialogs: centered overlay, `rounded-3xl`, dark background with backdrop blur.
- Navbar: top bar with dark background and bottom border.

## Icons

Lucide React. Stroke-based icons only — no filled variants. Icon sizes: `h-4 w-4` for inline, `h-5 w-5` for buttons, `h-8 w-8` for feature icons in empty states.
